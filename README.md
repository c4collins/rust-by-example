# Rust By Example

I'm going through [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html) and writing all the code out to learn Rust like how I learned Python (with [python-standard-library-examples](https://github.com/c4collins/python-standard-library-examples)).

I'm not sure what will happen with this repo once I'm done the Rust By Example series of things. I may retire it and move on, or I may continue to expand it with examples from the standard library to expand my knowledge of the core of Rust (again, like I did with [python-standard-library-examples](https://github.com/c4collins/python-standard-library-examples)). If I do this I'll probably make a website to highlight interesting parts like [Python 3 Module of the Week](https://pymotw.com/3/) which inspired my Python efforts.

## Running

Rust and `cargo` must be installed and working on your system.

1. Clone this repo
3. Optionally, modify `src/main.rs` to run the examples you want to see
3. `cargo run`
4. Read the code in the module as you look through the console output

## Contributing

I don't really know that there are any PRs I'd merge because this is about learning Rust for myself, but I'll definitely read any Issues/PRs made and try to integrate the changes they propose into my understanding of Rust and therefore into the code, so if you open an Issue/PR make sure it's descriptive and helpful.
